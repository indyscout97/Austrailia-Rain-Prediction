# Austrailia-Rain-Prediction
Machine Learning Project with the goal of predicting next day rainfall. This project uses a Kaggle dataset containing historical weather metrics from Austrailia. Here is a link to the Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package/

This is a WIP project. At the time of writing this, the dataset has been fully cleaned and is ready for model implementation, however no models have been created yet. While this is a group project, the jupyter notebook in the notebook is an original work by myself. I used the datacleaning to write a new .csv which my team will use to create their own models. 

This is a group project with the following team: Jack Beck, Jordan Waldroop, Anuraag Hooda, Dria Fabrizio

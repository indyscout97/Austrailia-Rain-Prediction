# Austrailia-Rain-Prediction
Machine Learning Project with the goal of predicting next day rainfall. This project uses a Kaggle dataset containing historical weather metrics from Austrailia. Here is a link to the Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package/download

This is a WIP project. At the time of writing this, the dataset has been fully cleaned and is ready for model implementation, however no models have been created yet.

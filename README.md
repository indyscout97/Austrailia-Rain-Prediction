# Austrailia-Rain-Prediction
Machine Learning Project with the goal of predicting next day rainfall. This project uses a Kaggle dataset containing historical weather metrics from Austrailia. Here is a link to the Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package/

The dataset used in the .ipynb is slightly modified from the original Kaggle version. My teammate Jordan Waldroop did some quick feature engineering to add a "State" column, where each record is given its respective Austrailian State based off of the city already present in the record. I've included this version of the data in this repository.

This is a WIP project. At the time of writing this, the dataset has been fully cleaned and is ready for model implementation, however no models have been created yet. While this is a group project, the jupyter notebook in the notebook is an original work by myself. I used the datacleaning to write a new .csv which my team will use to create their own models. 

This is a group project with the following team: Jack Beck, Jordan Waldroop, Anuraag Hooda, Dria Fabrizio
